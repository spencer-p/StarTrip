# StarTrip

This is an Android app that measures how many times you spin around in a circle in a given time period. It is named after [star tripping](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=star+tripping), another activity that involves spinning around in a circle too much.

This project was written in the middle of the night at [CruzHacks](http://cruzhacks.com/) 2018. It was not my final project but I had fun learning about the gyroscope sensor on Android and whipping this up.
